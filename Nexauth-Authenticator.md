# Nexauth-Authenticator
[Nexauth-Authenticator](https://github.com/luth31/Nexauth-iOS) is a SwiftUI application that allows an user to register an account and enroll the device as that account's authenticator. During the registration process, a new ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) key is created, using the NIST P-256 curve, key that leverages ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) to sign requests. 

The key is generated by Apple's Secure Enclave cryptoprocessor, the application being able only to reference only an encrypted version of the key. During the key creation process, an accessControl object with protection set to  `kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly` and flags set to `[.privateKeyUsage, .biometryCurrentSet]` is passed to the PrivateKey constructor. The protection parameter guarantees that the key will not be restored from a backup and it will be usable only on this device and only when the device is in an actively unlocked state. The first flag allows the key to be used to sign data and the second flag will guarantee that the user is asked for biometric local authentication (FaceID or TouchID) before each use of the key.
